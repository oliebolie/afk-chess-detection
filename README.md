# afk-chess-detection
This project will notificate you when your opponent on chess.com plays a move. Useful if your opponent is stalling

How to use:

1. Download the zip file
2. Extract the folder where you like
3. In your terminal, go to the path of the scripts
4. pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Make sure you are in a chess.com game, its not your turn and your chess.com game is fullscreen (focusmode) DONT FULL SCREEN YOUR BROWSER. IT WILL NOT WORK THEN
6. Run the python script. If you are playing white run: "afkchesswhite.py" if you are playing black, you run: "afkchessblack.py"

To give some clairity:

This scripts will check the color of your timer. Dont put your terminal above the timers
The scripts runs with no delay
After every time the script runs it will ask you if you want to check again. If you hear the bleeping sound, dont close the terminal yet. Most stallers will play after a long time 1 move to hope you dont get back. You should keep the option availible to run the script again.
